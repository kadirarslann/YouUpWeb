        text:`This breathing awareness relaxation script will guide you to focus on each stage of a breath as you breathe slowly and gently.

        Let's begin. Throughout this breathing awareness exercise, breathe in this way:
        
        Breathe in to the count of four, hold for the count of 3, and breathe out to the count of 5.
        
        It goes like this:
        
        Breathe in...2....3....4..... hold...2...3....exhale...2....3....4....5...
        
        Breathe in...2....3....4..... hold...2...3....exhale...2....3....4....5...
        
        Breathe in...2....3....4..... hold...2...3....exhale...2....3....4....5...
        
        Breathe in...2....3....4..... hold...2...3....exhale...2....3....4....5...
        
        Continue to breathe at this slow pace.
        
        While you are breathing slowly, I'll direct your breathing awareness to different stages of the breath. Focus all of your attention on each stage I mention.
        
        First, notice the breath as it enters your nose. Notice each time you breathe in, the way the breath feels on your nostrils.
        
        Feel the breath as it passes through your nasal passages, and down behind your throat.
        
        Where does the air go next? Feel each time you inhale, the breath passing down your windpipe.
        
        Feel the breath going down.....
        
        Feel the breath going down....
        
        Notice where the air enters your lungs. Allow your breathing awareness to deepen the feeling of relaxation you are experiencing.
        
        Feel the air expand your lungs with each in breath.
        
        Feel your lungs expand... and relax.... expand.... and relax..... expand.... and relax.....
        
        Now notice the exhalation phase of breathing. Observe as the air leaves your lungs and begins to travel upward. Focus your attention on that moment of each breath.
        
        Now turn your attention to the breath traveling up and out, through your mouth. Feel the breath in your throat, your mouth, and across your lips.
        
        Notice each breath as a whole now. See how the breaths flow like waves. Fist in.... and then a pause.... and out.... and then a pause.... Notice the pauses, these rests between breaths.
        
        Now as you relax... you can count your breaths as they continue to flow gently. Count 10 breaths.
        
        (pause)
        
        When you are finished counting your breaths, notice how calm and relaxed you are. See how regular your breathing has become... how calm your breathing is.
        
        When you are ready to return to your day, you can reawaken your body and return to the present. I'll count to five. With each number, you can become more and more alert, reaching full alertness when I reach 5.

        text:`During this breathing meditation, you will focus on your breath. This will calm your mind and relax your body.

        There is no right or wrong way to meditate. Whatever you experience during this breathing meditation is right for you. Don’t try to make anything happen, just observe.
        
        Begin by finding a comfortable position, but one in which you will not fall asleep. Sitting on the floor with your legs crossed is a good position to try.
        
        Close your eyes or focus on one spot in the room.
        
        Roll your shoulders slowly forward and then slowly back.
        
        Lean your head from side to side, lowering your left ear toward your left shoulder, and then your right ear toward your right shoulder.
        
        Relax your muscles.
        
        Your body will continue to relax as you meditate.
        
        Observe your breathing. Notice how your breath flows in and out. Make no effort to change your breathing in any way, simply notice how your body breathes. Your body knows how much air it needs.
        
        Sit quietly, seeing in your mind’s eye your breath flowing gently in and out of your body.
        
        When your attention wanders, as it will, just focus back again on your breathing.
        
        Notice any stray thoughts, but don’t dwell on them. Simply let the thoughts pass.
        
        See how your breath continues to flow...deeply... calmly.
        
        Notice the stages of a complete breath... from the in breath... to the pause that follows... the exhale... and the pause before taking another breath...
        
        See the slight breaks between each breath.
        
        Feel the air entering through your nose...picture the breath flowing through the cavities in your sinuses and then down to your lungs...
        
        As thoughts intrude, allow them to pass, and return your attention to your breathing.
        
        (Pause)
        
        See the air inside your body after you inhale, filling your body gently.
        
        Notice how the space inside your lungs becomes smaller after you exhale and the air leaves your body.
        
        Feel your chest and stomach gently rise and fall with each breath.
        
        Now as you inhale, count silently... one
        
        As you exhale, count...one
        
        Wait for the next breath, and count again... one
        
        Exhale...one
        
        Inhale...one
        
        Exhale...one
        
        Continue to count each inhalation and exhalation as "one."
        
        (Pause)
        
        Notice now how your body feels.
        
        See how calm and gentle your breathing is, and how relaxed your body feels.
        
        Now it is time to gently reawaken your body and mind.
        
        Keeping your eyes closed, notice the sounds around you. Feel the floor beneath you. Feel your clothes against your body.
        
        Wiggle your fingers and toes.
        
        Shrug your shoulders.
        
        Open your eyes, and remain sitting for a few moments longer.
        
        Straighten out your legs, and stretch your arms and legs gently.
        
        Sit for a few moments more, enjoying how relaxed you feel, and experiencing your body reawaken and your mind returning to its usual level of alertness.
        
        Slowly return to a standing position, and continue with the rest of your day, feeling re-energized.`

        Enjoy the feeling of relaxation. Notice how you are feeling now, physically and mentally, and notice how it feels to be more relaxed.
        
        (pause)
        
        When you are ready to conclude your counting meditation session, take a few moments to reawaken your mind and body.
        
        Turn your attention to your surroundings. Notice the sights and sounds around you as you become more aware and alert.
        
        Move your arms and legs, feeling your body reawaken. Stretch if you want to. Feel your body waking up.
        
        When you have returned to your usual level of wakefulness, you can return to your usual activities, keeping with you a feeling of calm.`

Part way through this script, you will have the opportunity to pause the recording to continue to repeat the words silently to yourself for a few minutes before resuming.

        To begin, find a comfortable position. Become aware of how your body feels. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, let your body begin to relax.
        
        Imagine that you are breathing in relaxation. Breathe out through your mouth, forcefully blowing out the air.... imagine expelling tension.
        
        Breathe in again.... and exhale as if you are blowing out a candle, blowing away tension.....
        
        Breathe slowly and gently now....

        face.... relax
        
        head.....relax...
        
        Scan your body now for any remaining areas of tension. Focus your attention on these areas, relaxing them more and more.
        
        Now that your body has started to become relaxed, I will introduce some cue words for relaxation. You can choose whatever words you like, but in this script, I will use the words "breathe" and "relax."
        
        With each breath in, say in your mind, "breathe."
        
        With each breath out, mentally say, "relax."
        
        Allow these words to relax you fully.... each time you hear them, allow your body and mind to become even more relaxed and calm. Let these relaxing cue words fill your mind.
        
        I'll guide you for a few moments, and then you can pause this script to continue repeating the cue words for another few minutes on your own.
        
        With each breath, repeat these cue words:
        
        Breathe in, saying in your mind: breathe
        
        Exhale, saying to yourself: relax

        As you settle into a comfortable position, just notice how you are feeling in this moment. Without trying to change anything, observe your body and mind. Pain management begins with observation.
        
        Where is most of your tension stored?
        
        Where is your pain located?
        
        What part of your body is most relaxed?

        Continue to breathe slowly, smoothly.
        
        Now continue the pain management relaxation with a passive attitude of observing. Do not try to make anything happen. Notice how your whole body feels. Passively observe, not trying to change anything. Simply take note of how your body feels.
        
        Take a few moments now to think about the pain you experience. You may not be in pain right now. Just observe the state of your pain in this moment. The way your body feels is always changing. The way you feel is different from moment to moment. A moment from now, you will feel slightly different from the way you feel right now. Just observe. Observe as each moment passes.
        
        Although pain is unwanted and difficult to tolerate, try for the next few moments to regard your pain with acceptance. Accept the way you are feeling right now physically and emotionally..... whether positive or negative..... allow your body and mind to just be....
        
        Accepting..... observing.....
        
        You may want to repeat some pain management affirmations with me now.

        I accept this pain I experience..... the whole of it.... I accept it.... letting go of the need to control or to change in this moment.....

        I accept myself.....

        There is nothing you need to be doing in this moment, besides accepting this moment just as it is.
        
        Observe again your pain.... and notice, that you can alter the pain slightly. See if you are able to transform the feeling, just a little.....
        
        Picture the pain.... notice its exact location. Imagine that instead of pain, this area feels cool..... even a bit cold.... as if you have applied a comfortable ice pack to this area. Feel the coolness.
        
        The area might even start to feel a little less cold.... closer to the way the rest of your body feels....
        
        Now focus in on this area, and imagine a slightly different feeling of your choice. You may wish to imagine the sensation of pleasant tingling... warmth... or soft but firm, comfortable pressure.
        
        Imagine this sensation now. Imagine the sensation replacing just a tiny bit of the pain..... and a tiny bit more of the pain...... more and more.....
        
        Feel this new sensation growing..... pleasantly.... providing some relief..... allowing you to relax.....
        
        Take a deep breath in..... and out.....
        
        in..... and out.....
        
        in..... out.....

        You can choose any phrase you want to focus upon for the meditation portion of this pain management relaxation. This will be your focus word. I'll use the word "peaceful" here. Focus your attention on this word with each breath. Every time your thoughts drift, focus in again on this word. Don't worry about making anything happen, or doing this meditation a certain way. Whatever happens is right for you at this moment.
        
        Keep an attitude of passive acceptance. Just accept the state you are in, and continue to focus your mind on the word you will be repeating.

        Focus your mind again on your focus word.
        
        As thoughts enter your mind, as they will, just turn your attention back to your focus word.

        Peace.....full......
        
        Peace.....full....
        
        Take note of how your body feels, now. See how relaxed your muscles are. Notice how calm your mind is. Enjoy this feeling of relaxation for a few moments more.....
        
        You can keep this feeling of relaxation with you as you return to your regular activities. Complete the pain management relaxation now... Memorize this peaceful, relaxed feeling, so you can return to this state whenever you need to.
        
        Slowly reawaken your body now. Take a deep breath in.... and out. Feel your mind and body becoming more awake and alert.
        
        Move your arms and legs, and stretch your muscles to let them reawaken from this pain management relaxation.
        
        Sit for a moment now with your eyes open, observing the room around you. When you are ready, return to your usual activities, keeping with you a sense of calm and relief.`

        Feel relaxation beginning at the bottom of your feet. It might feel like stepping into a warm bathtub... or it may feel like a tingling sensation.... or simply calm and loose. Allow the relaxation to spread over your feet, and up to your ankles.
        
        Feel the relaxation rising above your ankles, flowing up your lower legs.... to your knees.... continuing up to your upper legs...
        
        Allow the relaxation to continue to spread throughout your body, rising now to your hips and pelvic area....
        
        to your stomach and lower back.....
        
        to your chest and upper back....
        
        Let your upper arms relax.... your elbows.... lower arms.... and wrists... feel the relaxation spread to your hands... relaxing the palms of your hands.... the back of your hands.... each finger and thumb.... your hands feel pleasantly warm, heavy, and relaxed.
        
        Feel your body relaxing further as the area by your collar bones widens and relaxes.... allow your shoulders to ease back slightly....
        
        Allow your upper back to relax even further.... let your shoulders relax.... and your neck....
        
        Feel the relaxation continue to spread to your chin... the back of your head.... your mouth.... your cheeks..... nose.... eyes....
        
        Feel your eyelids, heavy and relaxed....
        
        Notice your eyebrows relaxing.... your ears relaxing.... and your forehead.....
        
        Your forehead feels cool and relaxed.....
        
        Let the relaxation spread further to the top of your head....
        
        Your entire body now is relaxed and calm. Feel the relaxation flowing throughout your body, from your head to your feet.
        
        You can relax even further as you let your spine relax completely. Starting where the top of your spine meets your head, feel the relaxation.... feel the muscles giving up their hold and relaxing....
        
        Feel the relaxation spread down your spine... down your neck.... upper back.... middle back .... and lower back.... all the way down to your tailbone at the bottom of your spine...
        
        Notice all of the muscles of your back relaxing completely....
        
        Feel the relaxation flowing throughout your body.
        
        Breathe in.... now hold that breath. And relax your muscles totally, allowing the breath to flow gently out your nose or mouth.
        
        Take another deep breath, breathing in relaxation....
        
        And release the breath. Breathe out any remaining tension.
        
        Continue to breathe smoothly and slowly as you mentally scan your body, looking for any remaining tension.
        
        If you notice any tension, focus on that area. Direct the relaxation to flow into that area, and then carry the tension away.
        
        Imagine that the air you are breathing can cleanse your body and remove tension. Imagine that each breath in carries relaxation. Picture the tension in your body leaving with each breath out.
        
        Now simply relax, calmly, enjoying the feeling of relaxation for a few moments.
        
        (pause)
        
        Focus your attention now on your body, and think about the healing that needs to take place.
        
        Create an image in your mind of your current state of being. Imagine the physical ailment that troubles you. It might be pain, or illness, or injury. It might be something diagnosed, or it may be a problem that is not yet identified. Whatever it is that you would like to heal, imagine this problem in your mind right now.
        
        Focus on the specific location in your body where this problem is present.
        
        You might want to imagine the problem as a dark area, and picture the healing relaxation as light. See the light of relaxation flowing through your body. Direct the light of healing relaxation toward the dark area.
        
        Your body has many ways of healing itself. See the healing relaxation promoting your immune system.... promoting strength... promoting growth of healthy tissue.... removing unhealthy matter from your body.... removing toxins, bacteria, or waste.... cleaning up your body....
        
        Imagine the light of healing relaxation flowing, swirling, touching the edges of the dark problem area in your body.
        
        You might notice small pieces of the dark area being carried away by the healing relaxation.... allow these dark pieces to leave your body as you breathe out.
        
        Breathe in health, healing, and calm....
        
        Breathe out tension, illness, and any problems in your body....
        
        Allow the light healing relaxation to continue swirling around the dark problem area... see the dark area getting smaller...
        
        Imagine the dark area completely enveloped by relaxation....
        
        See the healing relaxation making the dark area lighter.... and lighter... carrying away anything that is not good for your body....
        
        Imagine your immune system working to heal you.... picture the cells you need going to the places they need to go.... working as needed to heal your body.....
        
        Imagine the healing relaxation flowing, coursing through your body.....
        
        Picture your body entirely filled with relaxation....
        
        See the problem area your body is healing.... see it becoming even lighter.... filled with relaxation.... carrying away any discomfort..... healing.....
        
        Allow your body to heal itself....
        
        Take a cleansing breath in.... and breathe out what your body does not need....
        
        Breathe in relaxation.... breathe out all the old air....
        
        Relax for a few moments and imagine the healing process going on inside your body.... feeling confident in your body's ability to heal.... feeling calm and at peace....
        
        (pause)
        
        Now you can choose to return to your usual level of wakefulness and alertness, or drift into sleep.
        
        If you choose to awaken, feel your body and mind becoming more aware of your surroundings.
        
        If you decide to sleep, let the relaxation deepen.
        
        I will count to three. When I reach three, you will be at your desired level of relaxation or alertness.

        title:"Dealing with Grief",
        text:`Begin by finding a relaxed position, sitting or lying down. Set aside a few minutes to relax.

        But first, I would like to talk a bit about the different types of losses.
        
        Grief can result from a variety of types of losses. Some kinds of losses are well-recognized, for example, death of a loved one, divorce, or loss of a job. Other types of losses can be just as difficult to deal with but may be less well understood. Losses may include loss of a pet, relocation, changing jobs, infertility, illness, or any other event that changes life plans.
        
        Loss can be experienced with both negative and positive events. An event may be positive overall (for example, getting promotion at work that you were hoping for), but still be associated with loss. Loss of what is familiar, loss of the old way of living...any sort of change can be associated with feelings of loss.
        
        Perhaps you are dealing with a change that is reasonably positive, and your grief is relatively simple to deal with. Maybe you are coping with a significant loss, and are going through a challenging grief process. Or maybe you have experienced a huge loss that has profoundly changed your life, and are having difficulty dealing with grief.
        
        Whatever your situation, your grief is real, and your loss is important.
        
        Though you need time in solitude to come to terms with the loss you have experienced, it is also important to accept support from others. Reach out to someone who can offer you support. You might want to call a friend, even if you haven't spoken in a while. It's okay to ask for what you need. Often people do not know how to support you, and they feel relieved if you ask for something specific. Ask for help! Even if it is just calling a friend and asking to eat a meal together...any small act of support can help you to feel less alone. You may also find it therapeutic to journal your grief, and here are some examples of eulogies other people have written to give you a few ideas.
        
        Before thinking about your loss and beginning the process of dealing with grief, let's start by relaxing. Close your eyes, and just sit or lie quietly. You do not need to do anything in particular.
        
        Take a deep breath, and as you breathe out, feel your body sinking into the surface you are on.
        
        Breathe slowly in...and out...
        
        In...and out...
        
        Keep breathing slowly and calmly, letting your breathing relax you.
        
        Imagine that your body is a fleece blanket. Imagine that the blanket is dipped into warm water. Imagine how it would feel to be floating, suspended in the warm water...gentle waves moving your body...
        
        Now picture being lifted out of the water...the heaviness of the water stretching the blanket...stretching your body...so you are very tall.
        
        Imagine that the blanket is placed on a warm concrete surface in the sun. Imagine how it would feel to be this blanket...so warm and heavy...completely limp...
        
        Steam rises from your body, warmed from beneath by the warm concrete, and warmed from above by the sun. Imagine how it would feel to be this damp blanket, and have the water slowly evaporating...becoming lighter and lighter...steam rising...carrying the water away....
        
        Feel your whole body becoming lighter...relaxed...totally limp...
        
        Let your body become completely relaxed...so calm...so serene...
        
        Now that you are starting to feel more relaxed, let's focus on dealing with grief.
        
        Dealing with grief is very tiring. You may have been feeling tired, stressed, and burned out lately...and this may be caused by the grief process. It is normal to be short-tempered and have problems with memory and concentration.
        
        These symptoms of dealing with grief can be troubling, but they are normal...and they will go away. You will gradually get back to feeling like yourself. Right now you are healing.
        
        The process of dealing with grief is similar to the process of recovering from a physical injury. When a physical injury occurs, the body needs time to heal and recover. Dealing with grief is no different. The mind needs time to recover and heal. You need the time to cope, and deal with grief. Be kind to yourself, and give yourself this needed time.
        
        Sometimes people who are dealing with grief feel like they are going crazy. You are not going crazy. What you are going through is normal and natural.
        
        There are several stages of grief, and it is normal to experience these stages...many of them more than once...in no particular order.
        
        It is normal to experience numbness, a time where you do not feel very much at all. This does not mean that you are insensitive or that you do not care, rather, it is the mind's way of protecting you and a normal way of processing a traumatic experience such as a loss. Numbness and shock are a normal reaction to loss.
        
        Another stage you may experience is anger. You may find that you are angry, frustrated, upset...it is okay to be angry when you lose something that is important to you...angry toward the person or thing you lost, angry at the world, at God, at the causes of your loss...you may even feel angry toward others who have not been through what you have. Not all of the anger is rational, and that is because you are grieving. People who are dealing with grief do not always think rationally. Your thinking will become more clear as you cope with grief. The passage of time will help to decrease the irrational thoughts and the extreme anger.
        
        You will probably go through a stage of questioning, wondering why...trying to get answers. It can be hard to understand why losses happen. As part of the process of dealing with grief, you may seek answers as to why the loss happened, and try to make sense of what has occurred. You may find yourself bargaining, trying to make deals with others, with yourself, or with God, to try to make things go back to the way they were before the loss happened. Questioning and bargaining are normal parts of dealing with grief.
        
        Another stage in dealing with grief is a stage of loneliness and sadness. This is a time of low energy, feeling slowed down, sad...maybe even depressed. During this time it is hard to focus and concentrate. You experience memory problems...sometimes feel confused...distracted...have difficulty sleeping...like you are not yourself. It's normal to feel this way because you are grieving. It is okay to feel sad and upset when you experience loss. These feelings can be very intense and painful. While you are getting through this pain, remember that it will gradually decrease as you heal. Even though it may feel like the sadness will go on and on, you will not feel this way forever.
        
        Acceptance is another stage of grief. During this stage you begin to re-create a new life in the aftermath of the loss. You begin to accept that things have changed. Your life is different...maybe not better...maybe not worse...just different. Acceptance is the act of coming to the realization that the loss has occurred, but you can move on.
        
        It is normal to proceed through the stages of grief in a non-linear order. For example, you may experience acceptance, and then return again to anger. It's okay to be wherever you are at. It is okay to ask questions and to feel upset. You have the right to grieve.
        
        You can get through this.
        
        You will feel better, and you will make a new life. Your new life may be different than the life you had planned, but you cannot always plan for losses.
        
        It's okay to experience a variety of emotions. It is okay to be angry. It is okay to be sad. It is okay to feel relief...and you still do care even if you feel relieved in some ways. It is okay to feel guilty. It is okay to feel impatient, to get upset at things that seem small and insignificant. You're going through a hard time, and a confusing mix of feelings is completely normal. This is the human experience of grief.
        
        You are coping...you are dealing with grief...and you will come out the other side stronger.
        
        You did not deserve this loss. It is not your fault. You are dealing with a situation that is challenging...difficult...perhaps devastating...and you cannot be expected to be over this immediately.
        
        There may not be any reason why things happened this way. Many of the things that happen in life do not make sense. You can grow and become stronger as a result of these challenges, even though there is no good explanation as to why you had to go through such difficult times.
        
        Even after you have dealt with the grief, you will have times where you feel like you are right back where you started. This is normal.
        
        Everyone has their own way of going through the process of dealing with grief. You do not need to grieve in a particular way. Do whatever is right for you. You can cry...or not. Be more busy...or less busy. Grieve in your own way.
        
        Though you need time in solitude to come to terms with the loss you have experienced, it is also important to accept support from others. Reach out to someone who can offer you support. You might want to call a friend, even if you haven't spoken in a while. It's okay to ask for what you need. Often people do not know how to support you, and they feel relieved if you ask for something specific. Ask for help! Even if it is just calling a friend and asking to eat a meal together...any small act of support can help you to feel less alone.
        
        You may even want to seek out others who are dealing with grief, to find support from people who can relate to what you are going through. You can find support groups in the community or on the internet.
        
        Allow yourself the time you need to grieve.
        
        Take good care of yourself. Eat well. Get exercise. Try to keep a regular sleep-wake schedule. You need the strength.
        
        Now if you want to, you can take a moment just to be with the feelings you have...just to allow the grief, face the emotions, and accept that you are grieving. I'll pause for one minute, and during this time you may choose to just relax and breathe deeply, or you might decide to just go with the emotions you have, and experience the grief.
        
        Do whatever feels right for you right now. If you need more time, go ahead and pause this audio, and resume whenever you are ready.
        
        Let's conclude this exercise with some relaxation, to allow you to get a break from the grief you are going through.
        
        Focus on your breathing for a few moments...breathing slowly in...and out...
        
        In...and out...
        
        Slowly breathing...relaxing...
        
        Create a picture in your mind, imagining a peaceful place where you have no worries. You may picture a comfortable room...quiet...peaceful...
        
        Imagine that the room is warm...and has a comfortable place to sit or lie down where you can relax. Imagine sitting or lying down...maybe on a pile of soft pillows...releasing all your worries with a sigh.
        
        In this room, you have no cares...no worries...no problems...nothing to worry about or think about at all.
        
        This is a place where you can completely relax...you can take a break here...even just for a few moments...to get away from all of the stress and tension.
        
        Picture this room in your mind. What does the room look like? Create a detailed image of this room in your mind...so comfortable...complete serenity...
        
        You can return to this room in your imagination when you need a break...whenever you need to relax.
        
        Whenever things get difficult and you just need a rest, you can picture this room in your mind.
        
        Now it's time to conclude this relaxation exercise.
        
        You may want to re-awaken or drift off to sleep. I'll count now from five to one. If you decide to wake up, let yourself become more and more awake with each number, until at one you are fully awake and alert. If you decide to sleep, become sleepier with each number, until at one you are deeply asleep.
        
        Five...

        Roll your shoulders forward.... and back..... now relax. Let the tension drain away from your shoulders.
        
        Now that you have moved your shoulders and arms to allow your body to begin to release the tension it has been holding, find a comfortable and relaxed position sitting or lying down.
        
        Stretch the muscles of your face as you open your mouth wide and breathe in .... yawn if you wish.... stretch the muscles of your face.... and let your face slacken gently as you breathe out.... relax completely.... let your lower jaw hang loosely below your upper jaw, your teeth not touching.
        
        Scan your body for areas of tension as you take another deep breath in. Feel the tension in your body as you hold that breath. Now let the tension go as you let the breath go.
        
        Point your toes, stretching your legs. Release the muscles of your legs and relax. Now bring your feet upward, toward your shins, stretching the back of your legs. Release the stretch, relaxing your legs completely.

        Your whole body is now fully relaxed...
        
        Enjoy the relaxation you are experiencing... use your left thumb and two fingers to gently squeeze your right thumb, while at the same time saying silently "relax," anchoring the feeling of relaxation to this spot.
        
        Experience the feeling of deep relaxation. Notice your breathing. Notice how calm and regular your breathing is.... watch your breathing, without trying to change it in any way.
        
        As you breathe in, say in your mind "I am relaxed."
        
        As you breathe out, mentally say "I am calm."
        
        I am relaxed
        
        I am calm
        
        I am relaxed
        
        I am calm
        
        Now squeeze your right thumb while mentally saying, "relax." Let the anchoring occur as this spot becomes associated with the peaceful, relaxed state you are in.
        
        Feel the relaxation deepen each time you squeeze your right thumb while saying "relax."
        
        Continue to allow the relaxation to flow throughout your body.... calm.... peaceful... relaxed.....
        
        (pause)
        
        Memorize this feeling of relaxation. Notice how your body feels. Notice how calm you are. Create a picture in your mind of this state of relaxation. With this image in mind, gently squeeze your right thumb one more time while saying to yourself, "relax." Feel the relaxation deepen.
        
        This spot is an anchor to remind you of the relaxation you are feeling right now. In the future, when you squeeze your right thumb, the feelings and memories of how relaxed you are right now will fill your mind, and your body will automatically relax.
        
        You are as relaxed as you want to be. Calm... Relaxed.....
        
        Warm...safe....comfortable...relaxed...
        
        (pause)
        
        Now it is time to start to become aware of your surroundings and return to your usual level of alertness. Keep your eyes closed for a few moments while your body reawakens.
        
        You can use anchoring any time to cue your body to relax. Remember the pleasant, peaceful state of relaxation, and know that your anchor can remind you of the relaxation you experienced.
        
        Count up, from one to five with me, becoming more alert with each number, until at 5 you are fully awake and alert.
        
        1, becoming more awake, more alert, energetic....
        
        2, feeling calm, awakening even more....

        text:`Get into a comfortable position, and set aside a few minutes so you can practice relaxing. The more you practice, the more easily you will relax under pressure.

        This exercise will review three ways to relax under pressure, including calm breathing, relaxing tense muscles, and calming your thoughts.
        
        Start by concentrating on your breathing. Breathe in...and out.
        
        Deeply in...and slowly out.
        
        In...out.
        
        Keep breathing slowly like this. You can slow your breathing even further by counting. Breathe in to the count of four...hold to the count of three...and breathe out to the count of five...
        
        Breathe in...2...3...4...hold...2...3...exhale...2...3...4...5...
        
        Breathe in...hold...breathe out...
        
        Breathe in...and out...
        
        Keep breathing...letting your breath slow comfortably.
        
        You are learning the relaxation skill of slowing your breathing. You can actually feel yourself calming down as you breathe slowly and calmly. This calm breathing helps you focus, and be alert and relaxed. You are learning how to relax under pressure.
        
        Continue to breathe slowly, and every so often, just notice your breathing, and focus on allowing your breathing to slow down.
        
        Now concentrate on your muscles. You may find that you are holding tension in your muscles. Pay particular attention to your shoulders, hands, and jaw.
        
        Consciously lower your shoulders. Let your shoulders relax and allow the muscles to loosen. This act of relaxing your shoulders allows you to become calm because it places your body in a relaxed, easy position instead of a tense one.
        
        Notice your hands, and let your hands be open, loose, and relaxed. Let your arms rest by your sides, letting go of all tension and just relaxing. You are learning how to relax under pressure.
        
        Focus on your jaw. Allow your jaw to rest loosely, so your teeth are not touching. Let your mouth be loose and relaxed.
        
        Mentally scan your body now, noticing any areas that are tense. When you notice tension, concentrate on relaxing that area. Allow your muscles to give up the tension they have been holding. Allow your body to relax. You are learning how to relax under pressure.
        
        Focus on your breathing again...noticing...relaxing. Count each breath again if you like, breathing in to the count of four...holding for a count of three...and breathing out to the count of five.
